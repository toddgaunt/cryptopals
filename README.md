This repository contains my implementation of the Cryptopals challenges (https://www.cryptopals.com/) in both Go and Rust. I am already quite familiar with Go as I use it at my day job, however this is my first time using Rust since my senior project at UNH in 2018. I am using this as an opportunity to exercise my cryptography skills and learn a new language. To this end, it has been helpful to implement the challenges in Go first, and then try to translate the solution to idiomatic Rust afterwards.
